Just now I think I decided what the very first feature I need is. I need a way
to have a list view of sessions I've recorded. Each list item should have the
date, the length, 3 subtitles, and a list of 10 keywords. The goal for the list
view is for me to be able to quickly access sessions related to a particular
project or goal or task so that I can review them and get back into the flow of
that project very quickly.
