# Primary Changes

There aren't any major changes in this changeset, but I'm really happy with
progress with both using `charm` and using `golang`. ChatGPT is ridiculously
useful when it comes to learning `go`, it's like having a developer who knows
`go` sitting at my desk, eagerly waiting for questions, and who knows exactly
what I'm trying to ask even when I don't exactly know myself.

# Other Changes

**Synchronize data dir with charm kv database**

**read/write chunked values from kv database**

**Render a list of options using the keys in the kv database**

# Next Steps

The goal is to have a list view where I can see every audio file and some minor
details about its contents. I guess it's an open question as to whether I should
implement that view while still relying on shell scripts for the processing or
implement the pipeline using `charm` and `go`. I guess I right now, today, need
a way to quickly scan the files and pick out the ones I want to work with. So
here is an MVP spec/steps:

1. Write a shell script that implements (x.m4a) -> x.m4a.topics.json
2. Write some go code that implements (x.m4a.topics.json) -> kv db
3. Write the list view
